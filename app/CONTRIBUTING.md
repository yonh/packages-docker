Getting started
---------------

2. Clone your fork.
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:yourname/packages
   ```
3. Make your modifications, commit your changes, and push to your fork.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "A short description about your changes"
   git push origin master
   ```
4. Open a Pull Request on [the terramar-labs/packages GitHub repo](https://github.com/terramar-labs/packages/compare?expand=1).
5. Be patient, but expect a response.
6. Work with the project maintainers on any feedback or changes.
7. Get your changes merged!

Other considerations
--------------------

* The master branch contains active development.
* Create or a feature branch or don't-- whatever you prefer!
* The project follows PSR-1, -2, and -4.
* Consider writing unit tests for your change.

### And don't be afraid to ask for help!
